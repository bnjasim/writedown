# writedown
Write your blog in Markdown, get result in HTML. Similar to the stack exchange writing area.

I now believe that a markdown editor is a better option than a WSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) editor.
(For a WYSIWYG editor, see my project: https://github.com/bnjasim/angular-rte)

This editor is made for writing articles to my blog: http://cslab.org/blog
